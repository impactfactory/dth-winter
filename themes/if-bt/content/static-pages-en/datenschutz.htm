<h2>General note</h2>

<p>Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data protection provisions of the Confederation (Data Protection Act, DSG.
	<!--DSG-->), every person has the right to protection of their privacy as well as protection against misuse of their personal data. The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data protection regulations as well as this privacy policy.</p>

<p>In cooperation with our hosting providers, we make every effort to protect the databases as well as possible from unauthorised access, loss, misuse or falsification.</p>

<p>We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

<p>Through the use of this website, we cannot guarantee the security of your data.</p>

<p>By using this website, you consent to the collection, processing and use of data as described below. This website can generally be visited without registration. In the process, data such as pages called up or the name of the file called up, date and time are stored on the server for statistical purposes without this data being directly related to your person. Personal data, in particular name, address or e-mail address, are collected on a voluntary basis as far as possible. The data will not be passed on to third parties without your consent.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2>Processing of Personal Data</h2>

<p>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. A data subject is a person about whom personal data is processed. Processing includes any handling of personal data, regardless of the means and procedures used, in particular the storage, disclosure, acquisition, deletion, storage, modification, destruction and use of personal data.</p>

<p>We process personal data.</p>

<p>We process personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law. In addition, we process personal data in accordance with the following legal bases in connection with Art. 6 para. 1 DSGVO - insofar as and to the extent that the EU-DSGVO is applicable :</p>

<ul>
	<li>lit. a) Processing of personal data with the consent of the data subject</li>
	<li>lit. b) Processing of personal data for the performance of a contract with the data subject as well as for the implementation of corresponding pre-contractual measures.</li>
	<li>lit. c) Processing of personal data to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject under any applicable law of the EU or under any applicable law of a country in which the GDPR applies is applicable in whole or in part.</li>
	<li>lit. d) Processing of personal data in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person</li>
	<li>lit. f) Processing of personal data to protect the legitimate interests of us or of third parties, unless the fundamental freedoms and rights and interests of the data subject are overridden. Legitimate interests are in particular our business interest in being able to provide our website, information security, the enforcement of our own legal claims and compliance with Swiss law.</li>
</ul>

<p>We process personal data for the period of time required for the respective purpose or purposes. In the event of longer-term retention obligations due to legal and other obligations to which we are subject, we restrict processing accordingly.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy for Cookies</h2>

<p>This website uses cookies. These are small text files that make it possible to store specific information related to the user on the user's terminal device while the user is using the website. Cookies make it possible, in particular, to determine the frequency of use and number of users of the pages, to analyse behaviour patterns of page use, but also to make our offer more customer-friendly. Cookies remain stored beyond the end of a browser session and can be called up again when you visit the site again. If you do not wish this to happen, you should set your internet browser to refuse to accept cookies.</p>

<p>A general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be declared for a large number of the services, especially in the case of tracking, via the US site <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> or the EU site <a data-fr-linked="true" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">http://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a>.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy for SSL/TLS Encryption</h2>

<p>This website uses SSL/TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as enquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognise an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line. When SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<p> </p>

<h2>Privacy policy for server log files</h2>

<p>The provider of this website automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Browser type and browser version</li>
	<li>Operating system used</li>
	<li>Referrer URL</li>
	<li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
	<li>Time of the server request</li>
</ul>

<p>This data cannot be assigned to specific persons. A combination of this data with other data sources is not made. We reserve the right to check this data retrospectively if we become aware of specific indications of unlawful use.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<h2>Third-party services</h2>

<p>This website may use Google Maps for embedding maps, Google Invisible reCAPTCHA for protection against bots and spam, and YouTube for embedding videos</p>

<p>These services of the American Google LLC use, among other things, cookies and, as a result, data is transferred to Google in the USA, although we assume that no personal tracking takes place in this context solely through the use of our website.</p>

<p>Google has committed to ensuring adequate data protection in accordance with the US-European and US-Swiss Privacy Shields.</p>

<p>Further information can be found in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=de" rel="noopener" style="color: inherit;" target="_blank">Privacy Policy of Google</a>.</p>

<h2>Privacy policy for comments on this website</h2>

<p>For the comment function on this website, in addition to your comment, details of when the comment was created, your email address and, if you do not post anonymously, the username you have chosen will be stored.</p>

<p><em>Storage of IP address</em></p>

<p>Our comments feature stores the IP addresses of users who post comments. As we do not check comments on our site before they are activated, we need this data in order to be able to take action against the author in the event of legal violations such as insults or propaganda.</p>

<p><em>The IP address of the user who posts a comment is stored. </em></p>

<h2>Use of Google reCAPTCHA</h2>

<p>This website uses the reCAPTCHA service provided by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google"). The purpose of the query is to distinguish whether the input is made by a human or by automated, machine processing. The query includes the sending of the IP address and possibly other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google. For this purpose, your input is transmitted to Google and further used there. However, your IP address will be shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of this service. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of reCaptcha will not be merged with other Google data. Your data may also be transmitted to the USA. An adequacy decision of the European Commission, the "Privacy Shield", is in place for data transfers to the USA. Google participates in the "Privacy Shield" and has submitted to the requirements. By pressing the query, you consent to the processing of your data. The processing is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. a DSGVO with your consent. You can revoke your consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent up to the revocation.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy for Google Analytics</h2>

<p>This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited. If the data controller on this website is located outside the European Economic Area or Switzerland, then the Google Analytics data processing is carried out by Google LLC. Google LLC and Google Ireland Limited are hereinafter referred to as "Google".</p>

<p>The statistics obtained enable us to improve our offer and make it more interesting for you as a user. This website also uses Google Analytics for a cross-device analysis of visitor flows, which is carried out via a user ID. If you have a Google user account, you can deactivate the cross-device analysis of your usage in the settings there under "My data", "Personal data".</p>

<p>The legal basis for the use of Google Analytics is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DS-GVO. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. We would like to point out that on this website Google Analytics has been extended by the code "_anonymizeIp();" in order to ensure anonymised collection of IP addresses. This means that IP addresses are processed in abbreviated form, which means that they cannot be linked to a specific person. If the data collected about you is related to a person, this is immediately excluded and the personal data is immediately deleted.</p>

<p>
	<br>
</p>

<p>Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. For the exceptional cases in which personal data is transferred to the USA, Google has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework</a>.</p>

<p>Google Analytics uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) by Google and the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a href="https://www.swissanwalt.ch/de/gaoptout.aspx" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Disable Google Analytics</a>.</p>

<p>You can also prevent the use of Google Analytics by clicking on this link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Disable Google Analytics</a>. This will save a so-called opt-out cookie on your data carrier, which prevents the processing of personal data by Google Analytics. Please note that if you delete all cookies on your terminal device, these opt-out cookies will also be deleted, i.e. you will have to set the opt-out cookies again if you wish to continue to prevent this form of data collection. The opt-out cookies are set per browser and computer/end device and therefore have to be activated separately for each browser, computer or other end device.</p>

<h2>Note on data transfer to the USA</h2>

<p>Our website includes tools from companies based in the USA. If these tools are active, your personal data may be passed on to the US servers of the respective companies. We would like to point out that the USA is not a safe third country in the sense of EU data protection law. US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this.

We have no influence on these processing activities.</p>
